## Extensions : Level 1 Cache
![Plugin](../../images/nucleus_plugin.gif)

DataNucleus is developed as a plugin-driven framework and one of the components that is pluggable is 
the Level 1 caching of objects (between PersistenceManagers for the same PersistenceManagerFactory). 
The Cache guide (<a href="../jdo/cache.html">JDO</a> or <a href="../jpa/cache.html">JPA</a>) defines 
three Level 1 caches but is a plugin point so that you can easily add your own variant and have
it usable within your DataNucleus usage.

DataNucleus is able to support third party Level 1 Cache products. There are DataNucleus-provided plugins for
weak and soft referenced caches. You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension _org.datanucleus.cache_level1_.

The following sections describe how to create your own Level 1 cache plugin for DataNucleus.

### Interface

If you have your own Level1 cache you can easily use it with DataNucleus. DataNucleus defines a Level1Cache interface and you need to implement this.
[![Javadoc](../../images/javadoc.gif)](http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/cache/Level1Cache.html).

	package org.datanucleus.cache;
	
	public interface Level1Cache extends Map
	{
	}

So you need to create a class, __MyLevel1Cache__ for example, that implements this interface (i.e that implements _java.util.Map_).


### Plugin Specification

Once you have this implementation you then need to make the class available as a DataNucleus plugin. You do this by putting a file 
_plugin.xml_ in your JAR at the root of the CLASSPATH. The file _plugin.xml_ will look like this

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<plugin id="mydomain.mycache" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    	<extension point="org.datanucleus.cache_level1">
	    	<cache name="MyCache" class-name="mydomain.MyLevel1Cache"/>
    	</extension>
	</plugin>

Note that you also require a MANIFEST.MF file as per the [Extensions Guide](index.html).

### Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your L1 Cache plugin. To do this you specify the 
persistence property _datanucleus.cache.level1.type_ as __MyCache__ (the "name" in _plugin.xml_).
