## Extensions : Member Annotation Handler
![Plugin](../../images/nucleus_plugin.gif)

DataNucleus is developed as a plugin-driven framework and one of the components that is pluggable is 
the handling of annotations at field-level. DataNucleus provides a support for JDO and JPA annotations, 
but is structured so that you can easily add your own annotations and have them usable within your DataNucleus usage.

### Interface

Any member annotation handler plugin will need to implement _org.datanucleus.metadata.annotations.MemberAnnotationHandler_
[![Javadoc](../../images/javadoc.gif)](http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/metadata/annotations/MemberAnnotationHandler.html).
So you need to implement the following interface


	package org.datanucleus.metadata.annotations;
	
	import org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolver;
	import org.datanucleus.metadata.AbstractMemberMetaData;
	
	public interface MemberAnnotationHandler
	{
	    /**
	     * Method to process a member level annotation.
    	 * @param annotation The annotation
    	 * @param mmd Metadata for the member to update with any necessary information.
    	 * @param clr ClassLoader resolver
    	 */
    	void processMemberAnnotation(AnnotationObject annotation, AbstractMemberMetaData cmd, ClassLoaderResolver clr);
	}

### Plugin Specification

So we now have our custom "annotation handler" and we just need to make this into a DataNucleus plugin. To do this you simply add a file 
_plugin.xml_ to your JAR at the root. The file _plugin.xml_ should look like this


	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<plugin id="mydomain.annotations" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    	<extension point="org.datanucleus.member_annotation_handler">
        	<member-annotation-handler annotation-class="mydomain.annotations.MyAnnotation" 
            	    handler="mydomain.annotations.MyAnnotationHandler"/>
    	</extension>
	</plugin>

Note that you also require a MANIFEST.MF file as per the [Extensions Guide](index.html).

So here, when the metadata for a member is processed, if it finds the @MyAnnotation annotation
it will call this handler after generating the basic metadata for the member, allowing us to update it.
