## Contributing

DataNucleus is an Open Source development. It is written by many people yet has a broad scope and so is in need of help. 
Since the software is free, you are benefiting from this work. You have a duty to contribute to the project, particularly if/when you have problems.
_It should be noted that many people use open source software without the minor intention of contributing anything back to it; 
that's ok but then should everyone adopt that attitude then things will not get improved, and additionally those people are not in a position to
request/expect any improvements that they would like to see (without putting something back in)._

__You can help the project in many ways__. Here are some examples

* __Answer questions on the [Forum](http://forum.datanucleus.org)__. New users need to learn somewhere just like you did when you first used DataNucleus.
You could monitor the forum when you have free time and attempt to answer people's questions. People will appreciate it even if you don't know all of the answers.
* __Debug problems in the code__ before reporting them on the Forum. You can isolate the issue to a particular area of code even if you don't know the solution, 
and post your findings on the Forum for one of the developers to pick up and progress further. __Better still, contribute updates__ so it saves our time in working 
out where the problem lies. These will be much more valuable to us. Since we use Git for source code repository the best way is to fork/clone a particular 
plugin project and submit a pull request with your changes. Please see the [DataNucleus coding standards](coding_standards.html).
* __Volunteer to be a developer__ of DataNucleus. To do this you need to start off by contributing patches for issues, and demonstrate your commitment to the project.
Once you've done this for a while then we'll invite you to join the project. You then go to the "Recruitment" section of our Forum and post the developer agreement
(stored in one of the threads in that Forum). Thereafter you can push DataNucleus further yourself when you have time. Be aware though that once you have been given
commit rights, inactivity for a period of time (e.g 6 months or more) will mean that you can lose these rights. Being a committer implies responsibility. 
You could volunteer to work on a particular part of DataNucleus (e.g RDBMS) or all of it, up to you.
* __[Donate to the project](donations.html)__. This will help to fund the time of one of the main developers and will mean that DataNucleus functionality 
will be expanded faster due to your help.
* __Contribute documentation or worked examples__ that can be included in the online documentation. If you think there is something missing from our documents 
then you can write it and contribute it and others will benefit from your work just like you have benefited from our DataNucleus product. You can contribute 
these via either the [Forum](http://forum.datanucleus.org) or by raising an issue in [JIRA](http://issues.datanucleus.org).

Obviously, __if you contribute to the system in some way then we are more likely to answer your forum questions, or listen to your ideas, so it's in your 
interests to participate__. We hope that the above has given you some idea how your time can be used to benefit the common goal of having a quality 
Java persistence solution free for all to use.

Neo4j, OOXML, EHCache, javax.cache, RDBMS connection pools, and much more. Also wrote version 2 of the plugin for
GAE/Datastore.

__Erik Bengtson__ : Founder of the DataNucleus project. Worked on the project since its initiation
as JPOX in 2003, until around 2011. Initiated support for Excel, XML, JSON and HBase. Currently inactive.

__Stefan Seelmann__ : Wrote the vast majority of the LDAP plugin, but currently inactive.

__Thomas Marti__ : Wrote an amount of the spatial plugin (now renamed to _geospatial_). Currently inactive

__Stefan Schmid__ : Wrote an amount of the spatial plugin (now renamed to _geospatial_). Current inactive

__Baris Ergun__ : Taken over responsibility for the geospatial plugin.

__Joerg von Frantzius__ : worked on the test suite, and RDBMS areas. Currently inactive.

__Renato Garcia__ : worked on the migration to GitHub, test suite flexibility, auto-generation of MANIFESTs, and some more.


In addition to those above, other people have contributed to varying degrees in the development of this software.

DataNucleus tackles a wide range of problem areas - are you interested in contributing to the DataNucleus 
project and want to get involved? The best way is to become part of the DataNucleus community and start 
by contributing patches. From that, gain commit rights. Where you take the project to from there is up to you.
