## Issue Tracking

The DataNucleus project uses GitHub issues for all issue tracking from April 2016 onwards.
Please navigate to the [source code of the plugin in question](sourcecode.html) and use the Issues tab to raise/inspect issues for that plugin.

DataNucleus used JIRA for issue tracking from 2004 until April 2016.
[DataNucleus JIRA](http://issues.datanucleus.org) still exists, and will continue to exist in read-only form for the foreseeable future, so you can see old issues and their resolutions.
