## Third-Party Products

While DataNucleus attempts to provide all tools specific to its domain, there are obviously
related areas where third-party products are recommended. If you have some product that
could be used alongside DataNucleus then we would like to publicise them here so that DataNucleus
users have all information at their disposal for designing their application.

OpenSource free products are publicised free of charge. 
Commercial products can also be publicised and you should [contact us](mailto:info@datanucleus.org) to discuss this, requiring a donation to the 
DataNucleus project.
