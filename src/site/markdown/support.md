## DataNucleus Free Support

With any software, there are times when you need assistance to make full use of it. Here at DataNucleus we want you to make the best of the 
software that we provide. For that reason we provide both commercial and free support facilities.
DataNucleus provides its own [__Forum__](http://forum.datanucleus.org) providing a place for you to discuss issues you are having. 
We don't guarantee to provide answers on this forum. It is simply a place where you could get some level of support when people have time.
This may not be adequate for some people hence why we provide the commercial version below.

1. Check the Documentation for [DataNucleus AccessPlatform](http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/index.html) before anything else. 
The answer is usually there, either in a tutorial/example, or in one of the many guides. Yes I know you can't be bothered, but then this is 
where you can do things for yourself.
2. Look in the [DataNucleus LOG](http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/logging.html). This usually contains a lot of information that 
may answer the issue. You can always configure the log to give more output.
3. Try a [recent build](http://www.datanucleus.org/download.html) to see if your version is out of date and the expected result is achieved with the latest nightly builds.
4. Go to the [__DataNucleus Forum__](http://forum.datanucleus.org) and ask. Always try to give as clear a description of the problem as possible, together with 
your input data, and any associated log output. __Please be aware that we have very little time for this type of support and contributors to 
DataNucleus are more likely to get any available free support__
5. Go over to [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/datanucleus) and post a question tagged as DataNucleus. We don't often go
there but you may find people who have experience of your situation to help you.

## DataNucleus Commercial Services
![AccessPlatform](images/logos/DataNucleus16-300.jpg)

DataNucleus is open source software, also providing good documentation and (public) test cases. As a result
your team could, in principle, train themselves up on the software using the documentation and tests as basis,
then when they come across problems look through the code and debug problems and/or develop new features. 
Often though you don't have the time to devote to such activities so would prefer to out source this aspect of 
your project. We provide for such situations and, since we wrote the software in the first place, nobody is better
equipped to explain how to use things and/or resolve your problems and get your project moving forward.
Note that we are the only company offering support for DataNucleus software, and we are the only company with
committers on this project, and our services are provided at very reasonable prices. 
__You cannot get better value and a higher level of DataNucleus experience than from us.__
Our various commercial services are defined below complete with pricing (_note that all prices are in UK pounds (GBP) symbolised by the £ symbol_)

* __[On-Site Consulting](#onsite_consulting)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) come to your site and explain first hand how to resolve the problems you 
are encountering and/or what is the best practice.
* __[Time-Based Consulting](#timebased_consulting)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) are available online at a mutually convenient time to provide answers 
to your questions via Skype/IRC/IM/phone/etc. Simply pay by the hour as and when needed.
* __[Support](#support)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) are available to respond to problems that come up with your deployments, providing workarounds 
to your problems, or providing rapid fixes. Optionally also allowing for feature additions to meet your requirements.
* __[Training](#training)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) can visit your site and provide a training appointment to suit your needs. _Subject to availability_.

### On-Site Consulting

We deliver on-site engagements to help organisations in achieving 
high availability and reliability requirements. This also enables a kick-start for projects thus 
reducing the learning curve for customer staff, and minimizing the risk of project failures. 
Additionally, engagements can be conducted to deliver proof of concepts with very short schedules.

DataNucleus experts apply their experience and best practices while working with 
customer staff to assess the environment, architecture, design and operational 
procedures. As an outcome of the engagement, the DataNucleus experts can deliver a 
detailed report over the findings, including gaps in architecture, design, 
recommendations to address potential problems. During the engagement the customer 
staff will likely become more skilled in the data access architectures in general, and 
in the DataNucleus product in particular.

<b>Cost</b> : For a European client £900 for a single day, £1750 for 2 days. Reductions for subsequent days. 
For clients in the rest of the world please <a href="mailto:consulting@datanucleus.com">Contact Us</a> for details. 
Customers are expected to pay for travel/accommodation expenses in order to fulfil such commitments on their site.
On-site consulting is not currently available in the USA.

<a name="timebased_consulting"/>
### Time-based Consulting

__DataNucleus__ also provides remote consulting using Email/IRC/IM/Skype to provide
you with the response when you need it to tackle the issues impacting on your project.
This type of support is where questions come up during your deployment of DataNucleus
and you need to ask questions for particular situations. You can pay by the hour as and when
you need it, when a consultant is available.

__Cost__ : 5 hours = £250, 10 hours = £440, 20 hours = £800.
Purchase of larger number of hours also available.
[Contact Us](mailto:consulting@datanucleus.com) for details

### Support

__DataNucleus__ can provide a level of support to meet your requirements, and rather than having
fixed off-the-shelf arrangements we prefer to tailor them to your needs. Below we outline some
typical options that could suit your needs. We cannot guarantee the availability of incident support for all problems
because some problems are simply too complicated to resolve easily; the majority of problems quickly point to where
the problem is, and what can be done about them, whereas things like some large query syntax is simply not resolvable
into a single SQL query so we may not be able to provide what you need in that case.
[Contact Us](mailto:support@datanucleus.com) for details.

* _General Support_ for the most common issues on API usage, defect reporting and bug fixing. It's available for free and on 
availability on our online forums though has absolutely no guarantee of availability. If you want to receive support when
it is needed, then consider the options below
* _Incident Support_ for dedicated support for a single incident.
* _Bronze/Gold Support_ for dedicate support covering multiple incidents over an extended period.
