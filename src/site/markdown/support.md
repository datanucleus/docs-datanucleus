## DataNucleus Free Support

With any software, there are times when you need assistance to make full use of it. Here at DataNucleus we want you to make the best of the 
software that we provide. For that reason we provide both commercial and free support facilities.
DataNucleus provides its own [__Forum__](http://forum.datanucleus.org) providing a place for you to discuss issues you are having. 
We don't guarantee to provide answers on this forum. It is simply a place where you could get some level of support when people have time.
This may not be adequate for some people hence why we provide the commercial version below.

1. Check the Documentation for [DataNucleus AccessPlatform](http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/index.html) before anything else. 
The answer is usually there, either in a tutorial/example, or in one of the many guides. Yes I know you can't be bothered, but then this is 
where you can do things for yourself.
2. Look in the [DataNucleus LOG](http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/logging.html). This usually contains a lot of information that 
may answer the issue. You can always configure the log to give more output.
3. Try a [recent build](http://www.datanucleus.org/download.html) to see if your version is out of date and the expected result is achieved with the latest nightly builds.
4. Go to the [__DataNucleus Forum__](http://forum.datanucleus.org) OR [__DataNucleus on Gitter__](https://gitter.im/datanucleus/Lobby) and ask. 
Always try to give as clear a description of the problem as possible, together with 
your input data, and any associated log output. __Please be aware that we have very little time for this type of support and contributors to 
DataNucleus are more likely to get any available free support__
__Please do not use Twitter and expect answers to support questions; support is not provideable in 140 chars!!__.
5. If you don't want to report the problem to us as in step 4 then go over to [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/datanucleus) and post a question tagged as DataNucleus. 
We don't provide support over there but you may find people who have experience of your situation to help you.
6. If you have a problem and don't report it then it really doesn't say much for your participation in the open source community.

## DataNucleus Commercial Services
![AccessPlatform](images/logos/DataNucleus16-300.jpg)

DataNucleus is open source software, also providing good documentation and (public) test cases. As a result
your team could, in principle, train themselves up on the software using the documentation and tests as basis,
then when they come across problems look through the code and debug problems and/or develop new features. 
Often though you don't have the time to devote to such activities so would prefer to out source this aspect of your project.
The developers of DataNucleus are flexible to finding a support solution that meets your needs.
__You cannot get better value and a higher level of DataNucleus experience than from us.__
Our various commercial services are defined below complete with pricing (_note that all prices are in UK pounds (GBP) symbolised by the £ symbol_)

* __[Time-Based Consulting](#timebased_consulting)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) are available online at a mutually convenient time to provide answers 
to your questions via Skype/IRC/IM/phone/etc. Simply pay by the hour as and when needed.
* __[Support](#support)__ : DataNucleus consultant(s) are available to respond to problems that come up with your deployments, providing workarounds 
to your problems, or providing rapid fixes. Optionally also allowing for feature additions to meet your requirements.

### Time-based Consulting

__DataNucleus__ developers can provide remote consulting using Email/IRC/IM/Skype to provide you with the response when you need it to tackle the 
issues impacting on your project. This type of support is where questions come up during your deployment of DataNucleus and you need to ask 
questions for particular situations. You can pay by the hour as and when you need it, when a developer is available.

__Cost__ : 5 hours = £270, 10 hours = £520, 20 hours = £1000, 40 hours = £1950, 50 hours = £2450.
Purchase of larger number of hours also available. [Contact Us](mailto:consulting@datanucleus.com) for details.
__Note that all amounts are specified in GBP (symbolised by the £ symbol)__

### Support

__DataNucleus__ developers can provide a level of longer term support to meet your requirements, and rather than having fixed off-the-shelf 
arrangements we prefer to tailor them to your needs. Below we outline some typical options that could suit your needs. 
We cannot guarantee the availability of incident support for all problems because some problems are simply too complicated to resolve easily; 
the majority of problems quickly point to where the problem is, and what can be done about them, whereas things like some large query syntax is 
simply not resolvable into a single SQL query so we may not be able to provide what you need in that case.
[Contact Us](mailto:support@datanucleus.com) for details.

* _General Support_ for the most common issues on API usage, defect reporting and bug fixing. It's available for free and on 
availability on our online forums though has absolutely no guarantee of availability. If you want to receive support when
it is needed, then consider the options below
* _Incident Support_ for dedicated support for a single incident.
* _Bronze/Gold Support_ for dedicate support covering multiple incidents over an extended period.
