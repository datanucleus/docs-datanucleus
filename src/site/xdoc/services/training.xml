            <p>
                DataNucleus is Open Source software. It is provided by a focussed team of highly experienced individuals
                to perform complex operations. While a company could deploy personnel to understand and extend
                DataNucleus themselves, it is often best to consult the experts in that software to maximise the benefits
                of its use. No other company can provide the training to the same level as we can.
            </p>
