        <section name="DataNucleus Support">
            <p>
                DataNucleus is Open Source software. It is provided by a focussed team of highly experienced 
                individuals to perform complex operations. Whilst it is Open Source and an amount of support can
                be obtained from the community for supporting deployment of such a technology, companies often
                wish to have something more specialised from people who know the product inside out.
            </p>
            <p>
                DataNucleus can provide a level of support to meet your requirements, and rather than having
                fixed off-the-shelf arrangements we prefer to tailor them to your needs. Below we outline some
                typical options that could suit your needs. Please contact us to discuss details.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>General Support</i> for the most common issues on API usage, defect reporting and bug 
                    fixing. It's available for free and on availability on our online forums though
                    has absolutely no guarantee of availability. If you want to receive support when
                    it is needed, then consider the options below</li>
                <li><i>Incident Support</i> for dedicated support for a single incident.</li>
                <li><i>Bronze/Gold Support</i> for dedicate support covering multiple incidents over an extended
                    period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are detailed below.

                It should be noted that DataNucleus support is "offered" by the likes of OpenLogic.
                They <b>do not</b> have access to DataNucleus committers, nor any DataNucleus experience, and
                that aside they charge a lot more for such support than what we do. You cannot get better value
                and a higher level of DataNucleus experience than from us.
