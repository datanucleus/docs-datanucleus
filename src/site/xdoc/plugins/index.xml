            <p>
                DataNucleus products are built from a series of plugins. Each plugin is an OSGi bundle. 
                Each plugin provides a level of functionality to the overall DataNucleus platform. This 
                section documents the available provided plugins, and their purpose and state.
                The plugins can be individually downloaded if required rather than waiting for the next
                full release of a product, but if doing that always be careful of cross-compatibility of
                versions of plugins.
