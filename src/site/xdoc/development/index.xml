        <section name="DataNucleus Development">
            <p>
                DataNucleus is open source, released under the Apache 2 license. As a result you are welcome
                to develop it further. We require assistance on many areas of the project should you be interested. 
                A few selected areas where work is needed are
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Development of JPA/JDO features</li>
                <li>Support for improved persistence to existing datastores (e.g Excel, LDAP, XML)</li>
                <li>Support for persistence to new datastores (e.g Cassandra)</li>
                <li>Development of DataNucleus tooling (Eclipse plugin, Maven plugin etc)</li>
                <li>Performance improvements</li>
                <li>Documenting the DataNucleus system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you are interested, please go to the <a href="http://forum.datanucleus.org/">DataNucleus Forum</a> 
                and raise a thread in the <b>Volunteers</b> forum. Please make sure that <b>you have time to spend on 
                DataNucleus development</b> before volunteering as this would only waste our time otherwise; we're not 
                interested if you only have a week or so and then disappear off onto something else.
                There are many interesting parts of the system to work on so this is your chance to get aboard the 
                project; and demonstrating to an employer an involvement in an open source project can be beneficial
                to your career.
            </p>
            <p>
                DataNucleus uses Test Driven Development (TDD). It has <a href="test/unittests.html">many test suites available</a> 
                and all should be run to provide stability in the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have DataNucleus commit rights (see 
                <a href="http://www.datanucleus.org/servlet/forum/viewthread_thread,75" target="_blank">Forum</a>),
                the development process should be as below. Please abide by these simple rules
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify <a href="http://issues.datanucleus.org">an issue</a> to work on. Raise a JIRA issue if it 
                    doesn't yet exist, and allocate to yourself</li>
                <li>Develop code, unit tests (as appropriate), and documentation for the issue. 
                    DataNucleus is developed using JDK1.6+.</li>
                <li>Run all DataNucleus tests and the (public) JDO TCK, and when all pass to the same level as before then
                    you can check your code into GitHub</li>
                <li><b>Broken unit tests or JDO TCK tests MUST BE FIXED ASAP</b>. Others are using GitHub latest too
                    and if you break either the build or the tests then it means they often cannot work effectively.
                    <b>Breakage of unit tests or JDO TCK tests mean that your changes can be rolled back</b></li>
                <li>Issues that involve many changes should be split, where appropriate, into smaller steps
                    so that you can still pass point 3 above with each check in</li>
                <li>Where changes are significant and you cannot split them into smaller check-ins (that pass
                    the tests) should be checked in to your own GitHub branch and when complete they should be 
                    merged into GitHub 'master'. If help is needed at this point then other developers should help in 
                    merging large changes</li>
                <li>All check-ins should have a prefix in the description like <i>[NUCCORE-23]</i> for the issue being
                    worked on. Then they will be indexed by JIRA and so we can track changes.</li>
                <li>Mark the JIRA issue as "Resolved" for the next release.</li>
            </ol>

            <a name="versioning"/>
            <subsection name="Versioning">
                <p>
                    There are many different versioning systems in use by software. All typically use
                    <i>major.minor.revision</i> (occasionally with finer grain below that). Some use suffix <i>alpha</i>
                    or <i>beta</i> to reflect how close the software is to full release. Some use versioning
                    starting at say 1.0.0, and going up from that until some release e.g 1.0.4 that is considered
                    the full release. <b>DataNucleus uses the following versioning policy</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we start a release lifecycle for a product it starts at 1.0 Milestone 1 (1.0.0.M1)</li>
                    <li>Subsequent releases increment the milestone ... 1.0.0.M2, 1.0.0.M3 etc</li>
                    <li>When we feel we are close to a full release we can optionally have 1.0 Release Candidate 1 (1.0.0.RC1)</li>
                    <li>We have as many release candidates as necessary to get everything feature complete</li>
                    <li>The full release is 1.0.0(.Release)</li>
                    <li>Any subsequent releases in that lifecycle increment the revision number, so 1.0.1, 1.0.2 etc</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The use of "Milestone" rather than "alpha" or "beta" is because all DataNucleus releases
                    are run against all unit tests and TCKs and so stability is typically inherent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We increment the <i>minor</i> version number when we are changing internal APIs (but not client facing APIs).

                    DataNucleus has the following mailing lists to aid in tracking development. They are read-only.

            <subsection name="Product Release Process">
                <p>
                    DataNucleus AccessPlatform is simply a bundled distribution and is typically released at intervals
                    every 1-2 months, usually taking the latest release of each related plugin and packaging it.
                    When there is a DataNucleus product to be released (e.g AccessPlatform), the following is 
                    the release process (administrator role)
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure that all required plugin versions are released. See the
                        <a href="#pluginrelease">plugin release process</a> below for details.</li>
                    <li>Go to the product that needs releasing update <i>build.properties</i> so that versions of all 
                        required plugins are set, and the version of the product is set. Check this change in.</li>
                    <li>Generate the required product archives (zips), and the documentation.</li>
                    <li>Release the archives and documentation on SourceForge</li>
                </ul>
            </subsection>

            <a name="pluginrelease"/>
            <subsection name="Plugin Release Process">
                <p>
                    Since DataNucleus development policy is that all current tests should always pass for checked in code then a plugin is
                    always in a releasable state. In general changes don't sit in the source repo for more than a month without release.
                    If a commercial client requires a particular feature or bug fix then a release is expedited. If some upstream plugin
                    needs releasing first then it is released before the plugin in question. We try to avoid any changes in internal APIs
                    that would affect downstream plugins if not in a new release cycle.
                    The following is the release process (administrator role)
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check that there are no unresolved issues in JIRA marked against the release version in question and, if necessary
                        complete the outstanding ones, or move them to a later version.</li>
                    <li>Should a developer have a good reason for the release not happening (e.g wanting to get another fix in first) then
                        the release could be delayed, but this is the exception not the norm</li>
                    <li>Use the Maven <i>release</i> plugin as follows : <i>mvn clean release:clean release:prepare release:perform</i>.
                        This updates the version to remove SNAPSHOT, builds source/javadocs/jar, creates a tag and finally copies it to 
                        Sonatype ready for release.</li>
                    <li>Go to the DataNucleus Sonatype account and check/release/close the repository artifacts)</li>
                </ul>
            </subsection>

            <a name="samplerelease"/>
            <subsection name="Sample Release Process">
                <p>
                    We try to make all samples use Maven and have the same release process, so then the released archive is consistent.
                    This is the release process for a sample
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to samples project and edit the pom.xml for version and dependencies</li>
                    <li>Create the assembly using <i>mvn clean assembly:assembly</i></li>
                    <li>Copy the zip file on to SourceForge (or get an admin to do it)</li>

            <subsection name="Metrics">
               <p> 
                   DataNucleus originated as JPOX in 2003 and consequently many people have contributed to its development over the years, 
                   and has been open source since the outset. In terms of metrics of the codebase you can get a measure of this by looking
                   at <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/datanucleus">the DataNucleus page on Ohloh</a>.
