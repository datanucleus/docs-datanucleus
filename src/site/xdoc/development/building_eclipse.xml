        <section name="Building DataNucleus with Eclipse">
            <p>
                DataNucleus can be easily developed using Eclipse 3.2+ (Eclipse classic, or RCP/Plugin - you 
                need a version that supports "plugin development").
                You also require JDK 1.6 and an SVN plug-in for Eclipse (Subclipse or Subversive).
            </p>
            <p>
                To develop DataNucleus using Eclipse you need to checkout the DataNucleus projects from SVN. 
                It's highly recommended to use a new Eclipse Workspace for DataNucleus projects.
            </p>

            <subsection name="Importing DataNucleus from SVN using Team Project Set">
                <p>
                    The quickest way to start is via the <i>Team Project Set</i> Eclipse feature. 
                    You need to download one of the below files and in Eclipse go to 
                    "File" -> "Import" -> "Team" -> "Team Project Set", then select the file downloaded and then 
                    "Finish".
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="datanucleus-eclipse-projectSet.psf">File for Subeclipse</a></li>
                    <li><a href="datanucleus-eclipse-projectSet-subversive.psf">File for Subversive</a></li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once importing has finished, you can develop DataNucleus.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Importing DataNucleus from SVN">
                <p>
                    Assuming that you dont have DataNucleus already checked out from SVN, in Eclipse go to
                    "File" -> "Import" -> "Other" -> "Checkout Projects from SVN", and select the projects in SVN
                    that you want to import. Repeat the process for all projects that you want to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have all of these projects imported then all can be built and you can develop DataNucleus.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Importing Checked-Out DataNucleus">
                <p>
                    Assuming that you already have DataNucleus checked out from SVN, in Eclipse go to 
                    "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects" and specify the location where you have, for example, 
                    DataNucleus "core". This will then import the already created Eclipse project for "core".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have all of these projects imported then all can be built and you can develop DataNucleus.
