                DataNucleus uses Maven <i>site</i> plugin for generating its documentation, and the documentation
                is stored in XDOC format typically.
            </p>

            <subsection name="datanucleus.org Project Site">
                <p>
                    DataNucleus has a main site <b>datanucleus.org</b> for the overall project and the commercial
                    services that we offer. This site makes use of a "skin" responsible for adding header/footer
                    to all docs as well as the dropdown menus.
                    This "skin" is available in SVN at
                </p>
<code>documentation/datanucleus.org-maven-skin/trunk</code>
                <p>
                    Now you need to build/install the skin, by typing <i>mvn clean install</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can access the documentation for <i>datanucleus.org</i> in SVN at

                    Now you can build the site itself by typing <i>mvn clean site</i>.
                    The site is then available under <i>target/site</i>.
                    The documentation is also generated every night from what is in SVN, and this appears on the 
                    website.

                </p>
<code>documentation/accessplatform-maven-skin/trunk</code>

                    <i>target/site</i>.
                    You can also build a PDF of the docs by typing <i>mvn clean pdf:pdf</i>, and this is generated
                    under <i>target/pdf</i>.
