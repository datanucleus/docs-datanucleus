                DataNucleus uses JUnit (3.x) for unit testing. The traditional style of "unit" test are included with 
                the project that they are testing. For example "core" has some "unit" tests, and these are run
                when you build the project.

            <p>
                <b>End-to-End tests</b> also use JUnit, and are available in the GitHub DataNucleus repository <i>tests</i>.
                In these tests we persist objects in a datastore, and test the result.
                There are several scenarios for this type of test, because JDO/JPA have many aspects. 
                By this we mean that we separate our tests into what they test. When developing anything, the tests 
                should be the guiding light as to whether you should be checking anything in to GitHub. 
                <b>If your change breaks things, you shouldn't check things in.</b> 
                We have tests divided by the persistence API that they are testing; look under the directories
                <i>jdo</i>, <i>jpa</i> and <i>rest</i>.

                    All DataNucleus end-to-end tests are based around a framework and this requires building first before running
                    any tests. Navigate into the <i>framework</i> directory and build and install it by typing
                </p>
                <source>mvn clean install</source>
                <p>This builds the jar under "target" and installs it into your Maven repository.</p>

                    This is a Maven plugin that allows some of the tests to be run with different configurations.

                    The <i>samples</i> project provides typical model classes to be persisted, with all different types
                    of relations. This project doesn't define <i>how</i> the classes are persisted, just what the classes are.
                    They are then usable by all persistence APIs. You should build and install it by typing

                    To run a test scenario, go into the scenario project and type

                <source>mvn clean test</source>
                <p>
                    This then runs the tests for that scenario. There are also occasionally additional tests
                    under <i>org.datanucleus.tests.knownbugs</i> and <i>org.datanucleus.tests.newfeatures</i>
                    intended for incorporation into the test scenario at some later point; these are not run by
                    default.
                </p>
                <p><b>To run the tests on a different datastore (default=H2)</b> type</p>
                <source>mvn clean test -Pmysql</source>
                <p>or replace "mysql" with "postgresql", "oracle", "mongodb", "hbase" etc</p>
                <p>
                    Long term strategy is to just have the overall test scenarios that apply just to JDO or JPA
                    and drop the datastore-specific scenarios except where providing some feature specific to that
                    datastore. Reality is that we don't have resource to do this yet, so typically run such as
                    <i>test.jdo.mongodb</i> for testing MongoDB, which obviously only tests a small subset of what
                    ought to be tested. <b>Offering your time to make all store plugins more feature complete
                    is the only way this task will be performed.</b>

                    which is why for every database there exist two files, e.g. "maven.datanucleus.datastore=hsql" refers
