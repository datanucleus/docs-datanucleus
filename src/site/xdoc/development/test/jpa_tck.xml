                ALl releases of DataNucleus since v1 pass the JPA1 (JSR 220) TCK. 
                JPA1 is a standard developed in private by the JCP. Its discussions were not open and the TCK is 
                not freely downloadable and so users cannot check any such claims for compliance. 
                This is in direct contrast to the JDO standard. We leave it to users to decide how they feel about that.
            </p>

                The tests below were run with JPA TCK 1.0b and DataNucleus GitHub master (v3.3) on 20/Dec/2013 against 
                MySQL 5.0.37.
            </p>

Completed running 435 tests.
Number of Tests Passed      = 435
Number of Tests Failed      = 0
Number of Tests with Errors = 0

                Sadly I'm not legally allowed to disclose any further details about these tests due to having to sign
                an NDA just to get hold of the TCK.

                As mentioned in <a href="http://datanucleus.blogspot.com/2010/04/jpa-and-role-of-compliance.html">this blog post</a>
                we applied for the JPA 2.0 TCK on 8th February 2010. This request was handled by Jonathan Nimer and
                Patrick Curran at SUN/Oracle. They (eventually) provided us with a form to sign and return to gain 
                access to the JPA2 TCK. This was returned to them at the end of April 2010 to their address of
                <i>4150 Network Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA</i>. We have since prompted them on more than
                3 occasions when we will be getting access to this secret TCK. They have still not provided it
                and as a result <b>we are forced to claim full compliance with the JPA2 spec</b> since testing is being
                hidden from us. The only possible conclusions for this unwillingness to provide the TCK as per their
                terms and conditions are either incompetence, or deliberate prevention of access. How do you, the user,
                feel about an organisation like Oracle preventing a level playing field for such technologies?

                Since the JPA "group" have still not published an official JPA 2.0 / 2.1 API jar into Maven Central
                we really feel that their priorities are not in the best interests of you the user. The basic
                minimum should be publish the official JPA API jars, and get a public open source TCK. Once those
                are in place then we can talk
