== Free Support

With any software, there are times when you need assistance to make full use of it. 
Here at DataNucleus we want you to make the best of the software that we provide. 
For that reason we provide both commercial and free support facilities.
DataNucleus provides access to public discussion/IRC facilities, providing a place for you to discuss issues you are having. 
We don't guarantee to provide answers, simply providing places where you could get some level of support when people have time.
This may not be adequate for some people hence why we also provide the commercial version further down this page.
To utilise the free support route :-

. Check the Documentation for http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/index.html[DataNucleus AccessPlatform] before anything else. 
The answer is usually there, either in a tutorial/example, or in one of the many guides. Yes I know you can't be bothered, but then this is 
where you can do things for yourself.
. Look in the http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/logging.html[DataNucleus LOG]. This usually contains a lot of information that 
may answer the issue. You can always configure the log to give more output.
. Try a xref:download.html#nightlybuilds[recent build] to see if your version is out of date and the expected result is achieved with the latest nightly builds.
. Go to the https://groups.io/g/datanucleus[__DataNucleus Groups.IO__] OR https://gitter.im/datanucleus/Lobby[__DataNucleus Gitter__] and ask. 
Always try to give as clear a description of the problem as possible, together with your input data, and any associated log output. 
*These are the only sites where we provide any free support*.
. If you have a problem and don't report it, or report it on a third party site that we don't use then it really doesn't say much for your 
participation in the open source community.

WARNING: Please do not use Twitter and expect answers to support questions

NOTE: We have very little time for this type of support and contributors to DataNucleus are more likely to get any available free support

DataNucleus is open source software, also providing good documentation and (public) test cases. As a result
your team could, in principle, train themselves up on the software using the documentation and tests as basis,
then when they come across problems look through the code and debug problems and/or develop new features. 
Often though you don't have the time to devote to such activities so would prefer to out source this aspect of your project.
The developers of DataNucleus are flexible to finding a support solution that meets your needs.
__You cannot get better value and a higher level of DataNucleus experience than from us.__
Our various commercial services are defined below complete with pricing (_note that all prices are in UK pounds (GBP) symbolised by the £ symbol_)

[[timebased_consulting]]
=== Time-based Consulting

__DataNucleus__ developers can provide remote consulting using Email/IRC/IM/Skype to provide you with the response when you need it to tackle the 
issues impacting on your project. This type of support is where questions come up during your deployment of DataNucleus and you need to ask 
questions for particular situations. You can pay by the hour as and when you need it, when a developer is available.

__Cost__ : 5 hours = £270, 10 hours = £520, 20 hours = £1000, 40 hours = £1950, 50 hours = £2450.
Purchase of larger number of hours also available. mailto:support@datanucleus.com[Contact Us] for details.

=== Support

__DataNucleus__ developers can provide a level of longer term support to meet your requirements, and rather than having fixed off-the-shelf 
arrangements we prefer to tailor them to your needs. Below we outline some typical options that could suit your needs. 
We cannot guarantee the availability of incident support for all problems because some problems are simply too complicated to resolve easily; 
the majority of problems quickly point to where the problem is, and what can be done about them, whereas things like some large query syntax is 
simply not resolvable into a single SQL query so we may not be able to provide what you need in that case.
mailto:support@datanucleus.com[Contact Us] for details.

* _General Support_ for the most common issues on API usage, defect reporting and bug fixing. It's available for free and on 
availability on our online support mechanisms though has absolutely no guarantee of availability. If you want to receive support when
it is needed, then consider the options below
* _Incident Support_ for dedicated support for a single incident.
* _Bronze/Gold Support_ for dedicate support covering multiple incidents over an extended period.

[[privacy]]
=== Privacy

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of users of our support services and we will only use the information we collect about you lawfully and in accordance 
with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”).

Data Protection legislation and the Act is currently going through a period of change. 
The introduction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the new British Data Protection Bill, which will replace the Act and is currently passing 
through Parliament is the basis of this change. This Privacy Notice is therefore intended to comply with the Act and GDPR but may change over time.


==== Data Subject’s Terms & Conditions

This Privacy Notice forms part of Terms & Conditions and should be read by Data Subjects, i.e. “you,” or an identifiable person using this site and DataNucleus support services (see below).


==== The Data Controller

The support services featured on this http://www.datanucleus.org/support.html[website] are owned and operated by DataNucleus. 
References to “we,” “us,” our,” or “the website” are references to DataNucleus. 
Our services are operated as self-employed within the UK, run by Andy Jefferson.


==== Data Protection Officer (DPO)

The mechanism for Data Subjects to raise concerns regarding the processing of their personal data by DataNucleus is to email: support@datanucleus.org; 
or send a letter by registered mail to: _DataNucleus, 2 Littledale Close, Derby, United Kingdom_.


==== Purpose of Processing Personal Data

We collect contact data to provide support services, and only collect such data when a contract is taken out by a customer, using their provided contact data.
We do NOT collect any personal data by simply visiting the Website.


==== Lawful Basis of Processing Personal Data

Our use of your information is permitted by applicable data protection law:

Because it is necessary for our legitimate interests in pursuing the purposes as set out above, and such interests in each case not being overridden by your privacy interests.


==== Categories of Personal Data Processed

The information we hold should be accurate and up to date. 
The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal data protection and security policies.

We will never collect sensitive personal data about you without your explicit consent and a clear explanation why it is required.


==== Sharing with third parties

We will, in general, not share your information with third parties under any circumstances.
The only exceptions to this would be :

* To external experts where a particular problem that you request support on requires expertise outside of our organisation; in this case we will explicitly request authorisation from you
to contact them, and what data, if any, should be shared. Such recipients would only have access to your personal information as required by them to perform their functions, 
and would not be permitted to use such personal information for any other purposes. Any such recipients will be subject to contractual confidentiality obligations.
* To government or law enforcement authorities if we determine in our sole discretion that we are under a legal obligation to do so.

guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Website or any third party; for this reason, any transmission is at your own risk. 
We will use strict operational procedures and adequate, technical and organisational security measures to prevent any unauthorised access, change, deletion or 
transmission of this personal information.


==== Retention of Personal Data

We keep your data only for as long as we need it. How long we need data depends on what we are using it for, whether that is to provide services to you, for our own legitimate interests 
(described above) or so that we can comply with the law.
We will actively review the information we hold and when there is no longer a customer, legal or business need for us to hold it, we will delete it securely.
