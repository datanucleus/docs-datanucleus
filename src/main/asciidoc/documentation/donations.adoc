== Donations

DataNucleus is an Open Source development. It is written by volunteers in their spare time.
They receive no payment for their development work (both providing the software, and for their time
answering your questions on the forum), and as a user you are benefiting from this effort. The 
DataNucleus project additionally incurs some costs in providing this software, in terms of hosting, and domain registration.

As an alternative to joining with us in writing DataNucleus, the DataNucleus project is open to receive donations to help fund the project. 
These donations will initially cover the expenses incurred by hosting etc, but can be targeted at particular bug fixes, feature requests, or 
providing email support to aid your project use of DataNucleus. Thanks for your support.


=== How to Donate : Bank Transfer

The first way to donate is to make a bank transfer, and you can arrange this by contacting one 
of the project administrators using the email _donations [AT] datanucleus [DOT] org_

=== How to Donate : PayPal

The second way to donate is to use PayPal. The disadvantage of PayPal is that a (small) percentage of any monies donated is taken by PayPal. 
If you wish to donate to the DataNucleus project via http://www.paypal.com[image:../images/paypal.png[]] (our account is __donations [AT] datanucleus [DOT] org__) 
you can use the following form.

Alternatively you can make the payment via PayPal yourself, and then simply send an email to _donations [AT] datanucleus [DOT] org_ stating

* The name on your donation with PayPal and the amount (so we can identify it).
* Whether you want listing in the donor list (and the name you wish to have listed - your name, or your company name for example).
* Whether your donation is a general donation that we can use to cover our expenses, or whether it is against a particular piece of functionality, or support.
