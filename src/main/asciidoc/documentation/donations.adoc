== Donations


DataNucleus is an Open Source development. 
It is written by volunteers in their spare time. They receive no payment for their development work (both providing the software, and for their time answering your 
questions on the forum), and as a user you are benefiting from this effort. 
The DataNucleus project additionally incurs some costs in providing this software, in terms of hosting, and domain registration.

As an alternative to joining with us in writing DataNucleus, the DataNucleus project is open to receive donations to help fund the project. 
These donations will initially cover the expenses incurred by hosting etc, but can be targeted at particular bug fixes, feature requests, or providing email support 
to aid your project use of DataNucleus. Thanks for your support.

=== How to Donate : Bank Transfer

The first way to donate is to make a bank transfer, and you can arrange this by contacting one of the project administrators using the email 
donations [AT] datanucleus [DOT] org


=== How to Donate : Stripe

The second way to donate is to use Stripe. The disadvantage of Stripe is that a (small) percentage of any monies donated is taken by Stripe. 
If you wish to donate to the DataNucleus project go to https://buy.stripe.com/14kbKX35qfUm9c49AA[this payment form, window=_blank].
